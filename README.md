# Queen and Drone Excluders

This project contains queen and drone excluders for beekeepers. The excluders
can be attached to the entrance bars of mating nucs:

* queen-excluder.stl: Avoids virgin bees from leaving the mating nucs (before
  transporting them to a mating station or before artificial insemination)

* drone-excluder.stl: Ensures drones cannot enter or leave the mating nucs,
  thus avoiding a mating station to be contaminated with foreign drones or
  weakened by taking drones home.

Most stuff is fully customizable in the included OpenSCAD source code. Feel
free to adapt as required.
